# ほしい

> [!summary]
> ほしい means "(I) want (something)". ほしい follows the い-adjective conjugation pattern. The object of desire is usually followed by the particle が. In negative sentences, the particle は is also used.

> [!info] Usage
> (私は)　 X が　ほしい ---> I want X.

ほしい is like たい (I want to do ... ), which we studied in [[Lesson 11#たい|Lesson 11]], and its use is mostly limited to the first person, the speaker. So, we use ほしい to say "I want this" but not for "Mary wants that". To talk about somebody else's wishes or desires, you either quote that person's expression of desire, or you describe it as your guess.

> [!note]
> Among the words we have learned so far, かなしい (sad), うれしい (glad), and いたい (painful) are similarly limited to first-person descriptions.

Or you can replace ほしい with the derived verb ほしがる, which indicates that you can tell by the way the person acts that they want something. ほしがる is like たがる in the first example below, which replaces たい ( see [[Lesson 11#たい|Lesson 11]]). ほしがる conjugates as an u-verb and is usually used in the form ほしがっている. Unlike ほしい, the particle after the object of desire is を.

> [!warning] Grammar Notice
> Because the core meaning of ほしい is "desire to possess" when you can use a verb + たい instead of ほしい, you should use the verb.
>
> 昼ご飯が食べたい。(X 昼ご飯がほしい)
> 旅行に行きたい。(X 旅行がほしい)

# ~かもしれません

> [!summary]
> かもしれません means that something is a "possibility". You can use it when you think that something may be the case.

> [!note]
> When you say かもしれません, you are less sure about the state of affairs than when you say でしょう. There are stylistic variants of かもしれません: in casual speech, you say かもしれない or just かも.

> [!info] Usage
> ==short form== + かもしれません ---> Maybe ...

You can add かもしれません to the short forms of predicates, in the affirmative and in the negative, in the present as well as the past tense.

> [!warning] Grammar Notice
> When the last part of a sentence is a noun or a な-adjective in the present tense, you put かもしれません directly after that noun or な-adjective. In other words, だ is dropped in such sentences.

> [!example]
> ウデイさんはインド人だ。---> ウデイさんはインド人かもしれません。
> Uday is an Indian ---> Uday may be an Indian
>
> 山下先生は犬が嫌いだ。---> 山下先生は犬が嫌いかもしれません。
> Professor Yamashita doesn't like dogs ---> Professor Yamashita may not like dogs

# あげる/くれる/もらう

Japanese has two verbs for giving: くれる and あげる. The choice between the pair depends on the direction of the transaction. Imagine a set of concentric spheres of relative psychological distances, with me at the center, you next to me, and all the others on the edge. When a thing moves toward the center, the verb we use is くれる. Otherwise, when a thing moves away from the center or when a thing stays away from the center, the transaction is described in terms of あげる.

> [!warning] Grammar Notice
> If a transaction takes place between others but you think you yourself have benefited because somebody very close to you received something, くれる is also possible. In the example below, you identify yourself more closely with your family than with somebody you have never met. Hence くれる.

With both あげる and くれる, the giver is the subject of the sentence, and is accompanied by the particle は or が. The recipient is accompanied by the particle に.

> [!info] Usage
>
> $$
> (giver)　は/が　(recipient)　に\begin{vmatrix}あげる\\
> くれる
> \end{vmatrix}
> $$
>
> (giver) gives to (recipient)

Transactions that are described with the verb くれる can also be described in terms of "receiving" or もらう . With もらう, it is the recipient that is the subject of the sentence, and the giver is accompanied by the particle に or から.

> [!info] Usage
> (recipient)　は/が　(giver)　に/から　もらう
>
> (recipient) receives from (giver)

> [!note]
> もらう implies that you feel closer to the recipient than to the giver. Thus もらう is not appropriate when the transaction is outbound.
>
> You can use もらう for third-party transactions if you can assume the perspective of the recipient.

# ~たらどうですか

たらどうですか after a verb conveys advice or recommendation. The initial た in たらどうですか stands for the same ending as in the past tense short form of a verb in the affirmative. In casual speech, たらどうですか may be shortened to たらどう or たら.

> [!info] Usage
> verb (==short, past==) + らどうですか ---> why don't you ...

> [!warning] Grammar Notice
> たらどうですか may sometimes have a disapproving tone, expressing criticism of the person for not having performed the action already. It is, therefore, safer to avoid using it unless you were asked for advice.
>
> Also, the pattern is not to be used for extending invitations. If, for example, you want to tell your friend to come visit, you do not want to use たらどうですか, but should use ませんか.

# Number + も/Number + しか + Negative

You can add も to the number word when you want to say "as many as".

> [!example]
> 私の母は猫を三匹も飼っています。
> My mother owns three, count them, three cats.

You can add しか ir to the number word, and turn the predicate into the negative when you want to say "as few as" or "only".

> [!example]
> 私は日本語の本を一冊しか持っていません。
> I have only one Japanese book.

> [!info] Usage
> number + も ---> as many as
> number + しか ない ---> as few as

# Expression Notes

- The use of short forms in casual speech ---> The dialogues in this lesson contain many examples of short forms as they are used in casual spoken Japanese.
  - 開けてもいい? ---> This is a question that simply asks for a yes or a no. These types of questions hardly ever have the question particle か at the end. The rising intonation alone marks them as questions.
  - わあ and へえ ---> You say わあ when you find something exciting. It is like the English "wow!" We saw this interjection of enthusiasm in Lesson 5. You say へえ when you hear something amusing, hard to believe, or mildly surprising: "Oh, is that right?"
  - こんなのがほしかったんだ。---> んだ s the explanation modality, the short form counterpart of んです. Female speakers have the choice between the gender neutral んだ　 and the more feminine の in closing an explanation sentence.
  - メアリーが編んだの? ---> Many question sentences in casual spoken Japanese end in の, which is the short form counterpart of the explanation modality んです. As are questions ending in んですか, most の questions are fishing for detailed explanations as a response. They are gender-neutral.
  - 着てみて。---> The te-form of a verb is used as a request. More politely, you of course would want to say ~てください.
- なあ --->なあ at the end of a sentence, after a short form predicate, indicates exclamation of admiration, frustration, or some such strong emotion. なあ is mostly used when you are talking to yourself.
- できる ---> できる has a number of different meanings depending on the context.
  - "can do/be good at/do well"
    - 日本語ができます ---> I am capable in Japanese.
  - "be completed/finished"
    - 晩ご飯ができましたよ. ---> Dinner is ready.
  - "appear/come into existence/be made"
    - 新しい店ができました。---> A new store has opened.
- ~からです ---> ~からです means "it's because ... "and answers a "why" question. The part that precedes から is in the short form.
