# Causative-passive Sentences

"Causative-passive" sentences are the passive version of causative sentences. You can use causative passive sentences when you want to say that you were made to do, or harassed or talked into doing, something that you did not want to.

> [!info] Causative-passive form
> いる and える: Drop -ru and add -sase rare ru
> う-verbs ending with **す**: Drop -u and add -ase rare ru
> う-verbs: Drop -u and add -asare ru
>
> Irregular verbs:
>
> - する -> させられる
> - くる -> こさせられる

> [!info] Causative-passive sentece
> 私は　彼女に　車を洗わされました。
> (puppet)は　(puppet master)に　(action)
>
> - The puppet is forced into performing an action. Marked with は or が.
> - The puppet master wields power over, and manipulates, the puppet. The particle is に.
> - The action forced upon the puppet is described with a causative-passive verb.

> [!note] Causative-passive and Causative
> Comparing a causative-passive sentece with a causative sentece, the actors are switched position.
>
> - Causative-passive: (puppet)は　(master)に　(action)
> - Causative: (director)は　(cast)に　(action)
>
> Note: puppet ~= cast | master ~= director

# ~ても

"A ても B" is "B, even if A". Meaning whether A happens or not, B still stands true.

You can form a ても clause by adding t to the verb or adjective te-form. With な-adjectives and nouns, you have でも.

> [!info] ~ても(affirmative)
>
> - verbs: て-from + も
> - い-adjectives: て-form (くて) + も
> - な-adjectives: Drop な + でも
> - nouns: Add でも

You can put a question word like だれ or いつ in a ても clause and have a generalized concessive clause meaning "no matter" or "regardless of" who, when, and so forth.

> [!info] ~ても(negative)
>
> - verbs: short negative - drop い + くても
> - い-adjectives: short negative - drop い + くても
> - な-adjectives: short negative - drop い + くても
> - nouns: short negative - drop い + くても

The ても clause itself does not have tense. It can be followed either by a present tense clause, or by a past tense clause.

# ~ことにする

ことにする means "decide to do..." It follows the short form present tense of a verb. You can use a negated verb, too.

> [!info] Usage
> verb (short, present) + ことにする --> decide to do...

We sometimes use the volitional form of this construction, such as 行くことにしよう , instead of the simple volitional form of a verb, 行こう, in suggesting an activity. ことにしよう has the additional implication that the suggestion is being made after a deliberation.

# ~ ことにしている

ことにしている means "do something as a regular practice" that is, you have made up your mind that you should do something and have stuck to that resolution.

> [!info] Usage
> verb (short, present) + ことにしている --> do ... as a regular practice

# ~まで

"A まで" means "till A". The A in "A まで B" is the description of the change that coincides with or causes the end of B.

The A, therefore, is usually a verb of the "change" kind. The verb in A is always in the present tense and in the affirmative.

> [!info] Usage
> verb (short, present, affirmative) + まで --> till A

When the subject of A is different from the subject of B, the former is marked with the particle が rather than は.

You can use "A まで B" in a sentence describing a situation in the past. Note that the verb in A is in the present tense nonetheless.

# ~方

方 follows the stem of the verb and means "the way in which the action is performed" or "how to do ...". - 泳ぐ -> 泳ぎ方 how to swim - 考える -> 考え方 the way people think

Nouns that are marked with other particles when they go with a verb are marked with の before
~方. - 漢字を読む -> 漢字の読み方 how to read kanji - 空港に行く -> 空港の行き方 how to go to the airport

_The goal of movement, normally marked with に can be marked with the combination of particles への. Therefore we also say 空港への行き方 (how to get to the airport)._

With compound する verbs: - 日本語を勉強する -> 日本語の勉強**のし**方

~方 is a noun and is followed by particles like は and を. - この野菜の食べ方はいろいろあります。There are many ways to eat this vegetable.
