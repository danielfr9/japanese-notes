# Honorific verbs

We use special verbs to describe the actions of people whom you respect.

| Word    | Honorific verbs | Irregular conjugations |
| ------- | --------------- | ---------------------- |
| いる　  | いらっしゃる    | いらっしゃいます       |
| 行く    |                 |
| 来る    |                 |
| ---     | ---             | ---                    |
| 食べる  | 召し上がる      |
| 飲む    |                 |
| ---     | ---             | ---                    |
| くれる  | くださる        | くださいます           |
| する    | なさる          | なさいます             |
| 寝る    | お休みになる    |
| 見る    | ご覧になる      |
| 言う    | おっしゃる      | おっしゃいます         |
| ~ている | ~ていらっしゃる | ~ていらっしゃいます    |

All the honorific verbs listed above are u-verbs, but some of them have irregular conjugations.

> [!note]
> When we use an honorific verb instead of a normal verb, we will have sentences which mean that somebody graciously does something. Thus, we never use these verbs to describe our own actions. Instead, we use them when we talk about what is done by (1) somebody higher up in the social hierarchy, or (2) somebody whom you do not know very well, especially when addressing them directly.

For the activities for which we lack special honorific verbs, we add the respect factor as follows:

1. Using ていらっしゃいます instead of ています, if the sentence has the helping verb ている.
2. Flanking a verb stem with お and になる.

> [!warning]
> You can turn most combinations of a verb and a post-predicate expression into the honorific style by simply turning the verb into the honorific form.
>
> It is, however, not considered in good taste to talk about what an "honorable" person can or cannot do, and may or must not do.

> [!note]
> ている is exceptional in being a post-predicate that regularly undergoes the honorific style shift.
> Special honorific verbs generally take priority over ていらっしゃる, as seen in the ご覧になる, but forms like 見ていらっしゃいます are also considered acceptable.

# Giving Respectful Advice

You may hear the form "お" + verb stem + ください in public service announcements and in the speech of store attendants.

> [!usage]
> お + verb stem + ください
>
> Ex: 切符をお取りください。Please take a ticket.

> [!info]
> Although such sentences end with ください, it is better to consider that they are (courteously phrased) commands, rather than requests. When somebody tells you お~ください, you are being encouraged to perform the actions for your own good.

With most する compound verbs, for example, the prefix ご is used instead of お. Note also the examples with special honorific verbs below.

- ご注意ください。 Please watch out.
- ご覧ください。 Please look.
- お召し上がりください。 Please help yourself.
- お休みください。 Please have a good rest.

# ~てくれてありがとう

When you want to express gratitude to someone for a specific action, you can use the te-form + くれてありがとう.

If you are thanking someone who needs to be talked to with the honorific language, such as when you and the person are not close or when the person ranks higher than you in any of the social hierarchies, you should say "te-form + くださってありがとうございました.

> [!info] Usage
> verb te-form + くれてありがとう ---> Thank you for doing...

# ~てよかったです

Te-form + よかった means "I'm glad that such and such is/was the case." If you want to mention something in the negative in the part before よかった, you can use the negative te-form なくて.

> [!info] Usage
> ~てよかったです ---> I am glad that I did ... / ... was the case
> ~なくてよかったです ---> I am glad that I didn't ... / ... was not the case

> [!note]
> You can use this pattern to say "thank you for being such-and-such a person" by using でいる instead of です.
>
> Ex: いい友達でいてくれてありがとう。

To show appreciation for an ongoing act of kindness, use the present tense ありがとうございます.

# ~はずです

You can say something is "supposed to be the case" by adding はずです to a sentence ending in the short form.

A はずです sentence is a statement about what you believe is true or likely, though you lack conclusive evidence. It is used when situations surrounding the case and/or our common sense point naturally to such a belief.

はずです cannot be used in a situation in which you are "supposed" to do something because of duty, responsibility, or law.

You can turn はずです into the past tense to describe something that was supposed to have been the case but actually turned out otherwise. The part that precedes はずでした is in the present tense.

You can use はずです with adjectives, nouns, and verbs.

| short form + はずです | It is supposed to be the case... |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| verbs:                | 来るはずです                     |
| い-adjectives:        | 面白いはずです                   |
| な-adjectives:        | 元気なはずです                   |
| nouns:                | 日本人のはずです                 |

> [!info]
> You see in this example that predicates in the negative can come before はずです. You may also hear another type of negative, はずがありません and はずがない, which means that something is inconceivable.

# Expression Notes

- Honorific forms of nouns and adjectives - Some nouns and adjectives are made into honorific forms by adding the prefixes お or ご. お is usually used with words that originated in Japanese and ご with words borrowed from Chinese.
  _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | _ | \_
  --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
  お~: | お名前 | お仕事 | お好き | お元気 | おたばこ | お忙しい
  ご~: | ご両親 | ご兄弟 | ご病気 | ご主人 | ご親切 | |
  Some other words are replaced by special vocabulary items.
  家 -> お宅
  子供 -> お子さん
  誰 -> どなた/どちら様
  どこ -> どちら
  どうですか ->　いかがですか
- たら in polite speech - We learned that the conditional たら is based on the past tense short forms. In honorific speech, たら also follows the long form.
  - お決まりになりましたらお呼びください。Please let us know when you are ready to order.
- それで/そして/それから - These "and" words are used in different meanings.
  - それで - "and therefore" (to introduce the consequence of what comes before it)
  - そして - "and in addition" (to say something notable)
  - それから - "and then" (to add an item that comes later in time or in the order of importance )
