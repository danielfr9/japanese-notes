# Transitivity Pairs

There are two kinds of verbs, transitive and intransitive.

- Transitive verbs are verbs that describe situations in which people act on things.
- Intransitive verbs are verbs that describe changes that things or people undergo.

Most verbs don't have a counterpart, but the following do:

| Transitive | Meaning              | Intransitive | Meaning                 |
| ---------- | -------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------- |
| 開ける     | open something       | 開く         | something opens         |
| 閉める     | close something      | 閉まる       | something closes        |
| 入れる     | put something in     | 入る         | something goes inside   |
| 出す       | take something out   | 出る         | something goes out      |
| つける     | turn something on    | つく         | something goes on       |
| 消す       | turn something off   | 消える       | something goes off      |
| \_         | extinguish something | \_           | \_                      |
| 壊す       | break something      | 壊れる       | something breaks        |
| 汚す       | make something dirty | 汚れる       | something becomes dirty |
| 落とす     | drop something       | 落ちる       | something drops         |
| 沸かす     | boil water           | 沸く         | water boils             |

> [!note]
> Transitive verbs call for both the subject (agent) and the object (the thing that is acted upon).
>
> Intransitive verbs call only for the subject (the thing or the person that goes through the change).

# Paired Intransitive Verbs + ている

When followed by ている, transitive verbs refer to actions in progress, while intransitive verbs refer to states that hold true after the change takes place.

# ～てしまう

The te-form of a verb + しまう has two meanings.

- しまう indicates that one "carries out with determination" a plan described by the verb. It typically involves bringing something to a culmination.
  - You, in other words, do something completely, or finish doing something, or have something done.
- The second meaning of しまう is "lack of premeditation or control over how things turn out".
  - This often comes with the sense of regret; something regrettable happens, or you do something which you did not intend to.

> [!warning]
> しまう can only refer to something regrettable happening or happened, **not** that something regrettably didn't happen.

In speech, ~てしまう and ~でしまう are often contracted to ~ちゃう and ~じゃう, respectively.

# ~と

The present tense short form of a predicate + と means whenever the situation described by the predicate holds true, another thing happens.

In most と sentences, the first clause describes the cause, and the second the effect.

> [!info] Usage
> clause A(short, present) と clause B。 Whenever A happens, B happens, too.

- Sometimes, a と sentence describes a cause-effect relationship between specific events.
- While the clause that comes before it is always in the present tense, the second clause can be in the present or in the past tense.

> [!warning]
> The event described by the second clause must follow the event described in the first half of the sentence.

If you want an adjective idea in the second clause, it is usually expressed as a change. It is very common therefore to find in the second clause an い-adjective base + くなる, and a な-adjective base + になる.

# ~ながら

You can connect two verbs with ながら to say that the two actions are performed at the same time. ながら follows a verb stem. The second verb, which goes after ながら, can be in any form.

> [!info] Usage
> V<sub>1</sub>(stem) + ながら、V<sub>2</sub> --> while V<sub>1</sub>-ing, V<sub>2</sub>

> [!warning]
> Note that the two verbs that flank ながら must be two actions performed by the same person. ながら, in other words, cannot describe an action performed while another person does something.

# ~ばよかったです

ばよかったです means _"I wish I had done or I should have done something"_. You can use it to describe an alternative course of action you, to your great regret, did not take.

> [!info] Usage
> Affirmative: ~ばよかった　 I wish I had done...
> Negative: ~なければよかった　 I wish I had not done...

All verbs can regularly be turned into a ばよかった sentence with no exception or irregularity. You form the ば-form on the basis of the present tense short forms.

ば-form

- Drop the final -u and add -eba (or turn the verb into the え form)

Verbs in the negative

- Drop the final い and add ければ

# Expression Notes

- おかげ - Noun のおかげ(で) is used to express gratitude for something or to someone when things turn out as desired.
  　- 友だちが書いてくれた地図のおかげで道に迷わなかった。
  　- A: 先生: 卒業おめでとう
  　- B: 学生: 先生のおかげです。
  - The expression おかげさまで (lit., Thanks to you) is the proper response when asked 元気ですか.
    - A: 元気ですか。
    - B: ええ、おかげさまで。
  - おかげさまで is also used to show appreciation for the addressee's help/support/ concern.
    - A: 仕事に慣れましたか。
    - B: ええ、おかげさまで、だいぶ慣れました。
