# Causative Sentences

You can describe who makes someone do something, and who lets someone do something.

いる and える verbs: Drop the final -ru and add -saseru
う-verbs: Drop the final -u and add -aseru
Verbs ending in う change to "w"
Irregular verbs:
くる -> こさせる
する -> させる

> [!info] Usage
> 先生は　学生に　会話を覚えさせました。
> (director)は　(cast)に　(action)
> The professor made the stuents memorize the dialogue.
>
> - The director decides what is allowed and what is to be done. Marked with は or が.
> - The cast performs the action. Usually goes with に.
> - The action is described with a causative form of a verb.

There are cases in which the cast gets を instead.

1. When the caused action is a reflex, such as crying and laughing.
2. When the verb that is turned into the causative originally did not call for を.

A causative verb can be interpreted either with the "make somebody do" reading or with the "let somebody do" reading. Thus you cannot tell simply from the sentences below in isolation whether they describe an authoritarian parent (forcing the children to eat what they do not want) or a doting parent (allowing the children to have what they want).

Only our general knowledge about the parents' personalities, the children's attitudes ( whether they are eager to eat vegetables/read books or not), and the linguistic context of the sentence solves the issue.

# Causative + てあげる/てくれる/てもらう

If the helping verb てあげる,てくれる or てもらう follows a causative verb, you can assume in almost all cases that it is a "let" causative.

You can use the causative + てください to ask for permission to do something and to volunteer to do something.

> [!info] Usage
> (director)は (cast)に causative verb (director) makes/lets (cast) do...
> (director)は (cast)に causative verb + てあげる/てくれる (director) lets (cast) do...
> causative verb + てください please let me do...

# Verb Stem + なさい

The verb stem + なさい is a command. なさい has a strong implication that you are "talking down" to somebody, or that you think you are more mature, know better, and should be obeyed. なさい, therefore, is appropriate for parents to use toward their children. You also often see なさい in exam instructions.

You can express the idea of the negative "don't do" using a verb followed by のを and やめなさい, which comes from the verb やめる.

Imperative Form (commands)
いる and える verbs: Change the last ru to ro
う verbs: Change the last u to e.
Irregular verbs:
する -> しろ
くる -> こい

You can also turn a verb into the negative imperative by adding な to the dictionary form. (Ex. あきらめる --> あきらめるな).

Some established uses of imperatives are not confrontational. You may see 止まる on traffic signs and road sur- face markings. You can also cheer someone on by saying がんばれ!

# ~ば

"Clause A ば Clause B" is a conditional statement: "if A, then B".

> [!info] Conjugation
>
> - Verbs in the affirmative: Drop the final -u and add -eba
> - Verbs in the negative: Drop the final い and add ければ
> - い-adjective: Drop the final い + ければ
> - な-adjective and nouns: Add ならば or であれば
> - な-adj/nouns negative: Add じゃなければ

In an "A ば B" sentence, the "A" part describes the condition, provided that the consequence described in "B" will follow.

Ex. 車があれば、いろいろな所に行けます。If you have a car, you can go to various places.

> [!info]
> ば also goes with い-adjectives and negative predicates in general. You drop い and add ければ.
>
> With な-adjectives and nouns in the affirmative, だ either becomes なら or であれば.

> [!note]
> You usually use the "A ば B" pattern when the condition "A" guarantees a good result in "B".
>
> Ex.
> **O** : 走れば、電車に間に合います。If I run, I will be able to catch the train.
> **X** : 歩けば、電車に遅れます。If I walk, I will be late for the train. [You can express the idea more appropriately with たら]

Because of this "good result" implication, "A ば B" is often used to advise "A". Sometimes the part "B" contains vacuous generic expressions like 大丈夫です or いいんです.

# のに

のに connects two facts with the form "A のに B". Where B happens even though it is not expected because of A.

> [!info] Usage
> A (short form) のに B --> Despite the fact A, it is B.

When A ends with a な-adjective or with a noun + です, it appears as な, just like in the explanatory んです construction.

> [!warning]
> Because のに connects two facts, you cannot have non-factual sentences, like requests or suggestions, in the B clause.
>
> **O** : この本は日本語が少し難しいのに、読んでください。
> **X** : この本は日本語が少し難しいですが、読んでください。
> Japanese in this book is a little difficult, but please read it.

# ~のように/~のような

You use "Noun A のように" when you want to describe an action which is "done in the same way as X" or a characteristic which is "comparable to A."

"Noun A のような Noun B" means "a B like/similar to A". When you say "A のような B", B has the same quality or appearance as A, or A is an example of B.

> [!info]
> みたい,which we learned in [[Lesson 17]], can be used in the same way as ~のように + verb/adjective, and ~のような + noun. Note that の does not come between the preceding noun and みたい.
>
> - たけしさんの犬はぬいぐるみみたいにかわいいです。
>   Takeshi's dog is cute just like a teddy bear.
> - あの人はマザー・テレサみたいな人です。
>   She is a person just like Mother Teresa.

# Expression Notes

- ちゃん -> ちゃん attached to a name is the diminutive version of さん and conveys affection. You can also replace さん with ちゃん in kinship terms to show endearment, for example, おねえちゃん and おじいちゃん.
