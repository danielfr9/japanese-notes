# ~そうです

You can add the そうです,of a report to a sentence ending in the short form. This そうです presents a "hearsay report" rather than meaning something is "seemingly" a certain way.

> [!info] Usage
> When we use そうです, the reported speech retains the tense and the polarity of the original utterance. We simply turn the predicates into their short forms. (Thus です after a な-adjective or a noun changes to だ, while です after an い-adjective is left out.)

To specify the information source, you can preface a sentence with the phrase ~によると, as in:

- トムさんによると (according to Tom),
- 新聞によると (according to the newspaper report)
- 天気予報によると (according to the weather forecast).

# ~って

You can use って instead of そうです for the informal form to quote what you've heard.

って is also the informal variant of the quotaton particle と and follows the short form in the same way と言っていました and そうです.

You change って to て after ん.
Ex. ロバートさんは何て言ってた?

# ~たら

たら is one of the words for conditonal (if) dependence. With a "A たら B", we mean that the event, action, or situation in B, is realized if and when the condition in A is met.

> [!note]
> The initial た in たら comes from the short form past tense endings of predicates.

Sometimes, the clause before たら describes a possible condition and the clause after it, the consequence which then follows. Whether or not the condition is actually met is largely an open issue with this set of sentences.

> [!warning]
> Note that when you say "A たら B", you cannot express a sequence of events in which B occurs before A; B can only take place at the time A comes true or later.

Sometimes, the たら clause describes a very probable condition, and the second clause describes the event that will take place as soon as the situation is realized. With this type of sentence, たら, simply arranges future events and activities in a temporal sequence.

Finally, the たら clause can describe a condition that is unreal and contrary to fact. With this type of sentence, you express a purely hypothetical condition and its probable result.

> [!note]
> A たら can only describe a conditional dependency that holds naturally between A and B. You cannot describe with たら an "if" dependency of the "B even if A" type, where B holds in spite of A.

# ~なくてもいいです

To describe what you do not need to do, take a negative sentence in the short form, drop the final い of ない, and add くてもいいです.

> [!note]
> You **can** omit も in なくてもいいです and say なくていい, which makes it slightly more casual.

# ~みたいです

みたいです follows a noun and expresses the idea that something or somebody resembles the thing or the person described by the noun. The resemblance noted is usually in terms of external characteristics, but not necessarily so.

みたいです can also follow a verb and expresses the idea that something "appears to be the case". It can follow the short form of the present tense and the past tense, both in the affirmative and in the negative.

> [!info] Usage
> noun/verb + みたいです ---> It looks like

> [!note]
> You can use みたいです about yourself, when you are not clear about the situation you are in.
> Ex. 財布を忘れたみたいです。

_みたいです can in fact follow adjectives too, but it is far more common to use そうです with adjectives._

# ~前に/~てから

You can use the present tense short form and 前に to describe the event before which something happens.

> [!info]
> verb A (short, present) + 前に verb B ---> B before A

The verb that precedes 前に is always in the present tense, whether the tense of the overall sentence is in the present tense or in the past tense.

To describe an event after which another thing happens, you can use the te-form of a verb + から.

> [!info] Usage
> verb A + てから verb B ---> A, and then B/B after A

An "A てから B" sentence can also describe the state of B that has held true since event A.
Ex. 猫が死んでから、とてもさびしです。
