# Extra-modest expressions

We use the verbs below when we want to sound modest and respectful in our speech, to show an extra amount of deference to the listener. Having one of these verbs is like ending a sentence with words like sir or ma'am.

|         |
| ------- | ------------- | ----------- |
| いる　  | おります      | (おる)      |
| ---     | ---           | ---         |
| 行く    | 参ります      | (参る)      |
| 来る    |               |
| ---     | ---           | ---         |
| 言う    | 申します      | (申す)      |
| する    | いたします    | (いたす)    |
| ---     | ---           | ---         |
| 食べる  | いただきます  | (いただく)  |
| 飲む    |               |
| ---     | ---           | ---         |
| ある    | ございます    | (ござる)    |
| ~ている | ~ております   | (~ておる)   |
| ~です   | ~でございます | (~でござる) |

You can use these verbs instead of the normal ones on very formal occasions, for example, when you introduce yourself at a job interview. (They are typically used with the more stilted first person word 私 [わたくし], rather than the normal 私 [わたし])

Can use them:

- Talk modestly about your own family or about the company you work for.
- Talk to customers.
- In public service announcements

ございます and でございます are very stylized and you rarely hear them outside formal business-related situations.

> [!warning]
> Because the effect of the extra-modest expressions is to put the subject in a modest light, you **cannot** use them to describe the actions performed by the person you are talking to or by somebody who is not in your group.

# Humble Expressions

Use the following pattern to describe you humbly do something out of respect for somebody.

> [!info] Usage
> お + verb stem + する ---> I (humbly) do

> [!warning]
> Not all verbs are used this way, so you may want to use only the ones you have actually heard used.

Examples to keep in mind:

- 私はきのう社長のご主人にお会いしました。I (humbly) met husband of the company president yesterday.
- 私は先生に本を貸しするつもりです。I intend to (humbly) lend my professor a book.
- 私は先生に辞書をお借りしました。I borrowed a dictionary from my professor ( and feel very obliged).

する - する ompound verbs do not follow this pattern. Instead they simply have the prefix ご or お. (ご紹介する,ご案内する, ご説明する, お電話する)

もらう/あげる - もらう and あげる have special replacements verbs.
もらう -> いただく
あげる -> さしあげる

> [!warning]
> The use of さしあげる is discourage to refer to "humbly doing something for somebody". Many people argue, you don't have a right to say you are doing a service for someone (you can't speak for them).

うかがう - うかがう is a verb with which you can portray yourself as humble in the actions of visiting and asking questions.

You can also talk about one of "your people" such as a family member or a coworker, humbly performing an action in deference to somebody outside the group.

Sometimes we can use a humble expression to describe a situation where we do something for the person we are talking to, meaning "for you" "instead of you" and "saving you trouble". (Ex. テレビをおつけしましょう。)

Summary

1. Honorific expressions exalt the subject of the sentence.
2. Extra-modest expressions talk modestly of what you do.
3. Humble expressions demote the subject and raise the profile of another person.

# ~ないで

If you do something without doing something else, the action not performed can be expressed with ~ない ( the short negative present) plus で. Note that the present tense form ~ない is used for both present and past actions.

> [!info] Usage
> verb (short, negative) + で --> without doing X

# Questions within Larger Sentences

You can include a question as a part of a longer sentence. Embedded questions are in short forms.

> [!note]
>
> 1. That the clause ends with the question particle か when it contains a question word like だれ and なに.
> 2. That it ends with かどうか when it does not contain such a question word.

> [!info] Usage
> Question-word question か　わかりません/しっています/etc.
> Yes/no question かどうか

Many people use か instead of かどうか in their speech for questions of this second type as well.

The present tense short form だ which is used with a な-adjective or a noun at the end of the clause is usually dropped.

We often use the particle が with the subject of an embedded sentence where は is expected.

Explanatory んです sentences can also be embedded. When a んです question is embedded, だ (the short form of です) is dropped, and ん is changed to の.

|                    |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Direct question:   | どうしてメアリーさんは来なかったんですか。         |
| Embedded question: | どうしてメアリーさんが来なかったのかわかりません。 |

# Name という Item

When you want to talk about a person or a thing that goes by a certain name, but if you believe the person you are talking to is not familiar with it, you can use the following pattern.

> [!info] Usage
> (name) という (item) --> (item) called "(name)"

# ~やすい/~にくい

You can describe that something is easy to do by adding the adjective-forming suffix やすい to the verb stem. A verb stem + やすい conjugates like an い-adjective.

To express that something is hard to do, you can use the い-adjective-forming suffix にくい with the verb stem.

> [!info] Usgae
> verb stem + やすい ---> easy to do
> にくい ---> hard to do

Sometimes, the subject of a ~やすい/にくい sentence is a place (where it is easy/difficult to do something), a tool (that is easy/difficult to use for some purpose), and so forth.

~やすい and ~にくい tend to focus on the psychological ease or difficulty of doing something when you use them with verbs describing actions. It is therefore odd to use やすい or にくい when the difficulty is defined in terms of a physical or statistical success rate.

- 漢字は覚えにくい。Kanji are hard to memorize (=I have kanji anxieties)
- 漢字を覚えるのは難しい。It is hard to memorize kanji. (=too complicated, too many)
