# Volitional Form

> [!summary]
> The volitional form of a verb is a more casual equivalent of ましょう. You can use it to suggest a plan to a close friend.

> [!info] Usage
>
> - Ichidan-verbs: Drop the final -る and add -よう
> - Godan-verbs: Change the last hiragana into the お column and add う
> - Irregular verbs:
>   - くる ---> こよう
>   - する ---> しよう

You can use the volitional plus the question particle か to ask for an opinion in your offer or suggestion.

# Volitional Form + と思っています

> [!summary]
> We use the volitional form + と思っています to talk about our resolutions.

> [!info]
> You can also use the volitional + と思います, which suggests that the decision to perform the activity is being made on the spot at the time of speaking. と思っています, in contrast, tends to suggest that you have already decided to do something.

> [!note]
> Note that verbs in volitional forms and verbs in the present tense convey different ideas when they are used with と思います or と思っています. When you use volitionals, you are talking about your intention. When you use the present tense, you are talking about your prediction.

# ~ておく

The te-form of a verb plus the helping verb おく describes an action performed in preparation for something.

> [!info] Usage
> ~ておく ---> do something in preparation

> [!note]
> ておく is often shortened to とく in speech.

# Using Sentences to Qualify Nouns

> [!summary]
> You can also use sentences to qualify nouns.

> [!example]
>
> 1. きのう買った　本　 the book that I bought yesterday
> 2. 彼がくれた　本　 the book my boyfriend gave me
> 3. 机の上にある　本　 the book that is on the table
> 4. 日本で買えない　本　 the book that you can't buy in Japan
>
> The verbs used in such qualifier sentences are in their short forms, either in the present (as in examples 3 and 4) or the past tense (1 and 2), and either in the affirmative (1-3) or in the negative (4). When the subject of the verb-that is to say, the person performing the activity-appears inside a qualifier sentence, as in example 2 above, it is accompanied by the particle が, and not は.

> [!note]
> A "qualifier sentence + noun" combination is just like one big noun phrase. You can put it anywhere in a sentence that has a noun.

# Expression Notes

- The use of short forms in casual speech ---> Let's examine some more examples of short forms used in casual spoken Japanese in the Dialogue.
  - 今度の休み、予定ある? ---> The verb ある calls for the particle が, as in 予定がある. The particles は, が, and を are frequently dropped in casual speech. Note also that this sentence is a yes/no question, and the particle か is dropped. (The question particle か is retained in special cases only, such as the pattern "the volitional + か ( Shall we ... ?)")
  - 思ってるんだけど ---> 思ってる is the contraction of 思っている, where the vowel い of the helping verb いる is dropped. Such contractions do occur in the long form (です and ます) speech patterns, too, but are most frequent in casual speech with short forms.
  - 言ってたから ---> 言ってた is the contraction of 言っていた, and another example of the vowel い in the helping verb ている dropping out.
  - 有名なお寺だよ ---> だ is systematically dropped at the end of a sentence, but it is retained when followed by よ or ね.
- ~けど and ~が ---> You can use けど and が not only in the sense of "but" (contrasting two situations), but also to present the background to what you are about to say. By inserting けど, you can indicate that you still have something to say at the end of the first sentence.
- Short present + 予定です ---> You can add 予定です to a verb in the present tense short form when you want to say that something is scheduled to take place.
  - You can also use 予定です with verbs in the negative.
    - あしたは学校に来ない予定です。---> I am not planning to come to school tomorrow.
- 見える/見られる ---> 見える is different from 見られる, the regular potential form of 見る. 見える means "something or someone is spontaneously visible"; 見られる, on the other hand, means that the subject of the sentence can see something or someone actively rather than passively.
  - The difference between 聞こえる and 聞ける is the same. 聞こえる means "something is spontaneously audible." On the other hand, 聞ける, the potential form of 聞く, means that the subject of the sentence can hear the sound actively.
- ~目 ---> The suffix 目 turns a number into a reference to a position in a series, like first, second, third, and fourth.
  -- | first | second | third
  ------|-------|--------|------
  ~ 人目 | 一人目 | 二人目 | 三人目
  ~ 枚目 | 一枚目 | 二枚目 | 三枚目
  ~ 年目 | 一年目 | 二年目 | 三年目
  ~ 日目 | 一日目 | 二日目 | 三日目
