# Potential Verbs

> [!summary]
> We use the potential verb to say that someone "can" or "has the ability to" do someting or that something is "possible"

> [!info] Usage
>
> - Ichidan-verbs: Drop the final -る and add -られる
> - Godan-verbs: Change the last hiragana into the え column and add る
> - Irregular verbs:
>   - くる ---> こられる
>   - する ---> できる

> [!note]
> There actually are shorter, alternative potential verbs for る-verbs and the irregular verb くる, which use the suffix -れる, instead of -られる. Potential verbs themselves conjugate as regular る-verbs.

> [!warning] Grammar Notice
> Those verbs that take the particle を can take either を or が when they are turned into the potential. できる, the potential counterpart of the verb する, takes が almost all the time. All particles other than を remain the same when the verb is turned into the potential.

You can also express the idea of "can do" using a more complex construction:

> ==verb dictionary form== + ことができる

When you have an を-taking verb in the ことができる construction, you keep the original particle を, unlike with the potential verbs.

# ~し

> [!summary]
> When you want to mention not just one but two (or more) reasons, you can use し in place of から. し usually follows a predicate in the short form:

> [!info] Usage
> (reason$_1$)し、(reason$_2$)し、(situation)。

In the very polite speech style, し can also follow the long forms.

> [!example]
> 私は来年も日本語を勉強します。日本が好きですし、日本語はおもしろいですし。
> I will study Japanese next year, too. I like Japan, and what is more, the Japanese language is interesting.

> [!note]
> When you use just one し clause, you imply that it is not the only reason for the situation.

You can also add the し clauses in a separate sentence, providing reasons for the situation just mentioned.

> [!example]
> 山下先生はいい先生です。教えるのが上手だし、親切だし。
> Professor Yamashita is a great teacher. He is good at teaching and he is kind.

> [!note]
> Note that you find だ in the present tense with な-adjectives and nouns, but not with い-adjectives.

> [!info] Usage
> い-adjectives: おもしろし
> な-adjectives: 好きだし
> noun + です: 学生だし

# ~そうです

> [!summary]
> We add そうです to い and な-adjective bases to say that something "seemingly" has those properties. When we say ~そうです, we are guessing what something is like on the basis of our impressions.

To form ~そうです sentences with い-adjectives, you drop the final い; with な-adjectives, you just drop な. The only exception is the い-adjective いい, which changes to よさ before そう.

> [!info] Usage
> い-adjectives: おいしい ---> おいしそうです
> (exception): いい ---> よさそうです
> な-adjectives: 元気(な) ---> 元気そうです

You can also use そうです with a verb stem to describe your impression or guess.

> [!example]
> このセーターは家で洗えそうです。
> It looks like this sweater is washable at home.

The impression you express may be an event about to happen.

> [!example]
> 雨が降りそうです。
> It looks like it will rain.

You can use そうです with negative adjectives, too. The negative ending ない is changed to なさ before そう.

> [!example]
> この本は難しなさそうです。
> This book does not look difficult.

Another option is to use the negative of そうです instead of negating the adjective.

> [!example]
> この本は難しそうじゃないです。
> This book does not look difficult.

You can use the adjective + そう combination to qualify a noun. そう is a な-adjective, thus we say そうな before a noun.

> [!example]
> 暖かそうなセーターを着ています。
> She is wearing a warm-looking sweater.

> [!warning] Grammar Notice
> In many そうです sentences, the guesswork is done on the basis of visual impressions. It is wrong, however, to assume that そう is linked only to the visual medium. Rather, we use そうです when we lack conclusive evidence. (For example, we say an apple is おいしそう before we have had the chance to taste it. Once we have tasted it, we can conclude whether it really is t おいしい) With an adjective for which visual evidence is crucial, such as きれいな, we do not use そう and say X きれいそうです for something looking pretty; if we can see it, we already have enough evidence to conclude that it is pretty.

# ~てみる

> [!summary]
> You can use the te-form of a verb plus the helping verb みる to express the idea of "doing something tentatively" or "trying something". You are not sure what the outcome of your action will be, but you dare to do it and see what effect it might have.

> [!example]
> 漢字がわからなかったので、日本人の友だちに聞いてみました。
> I did not know the kanji, so I tried asking a Japanese friend of mine.

# ~なら

You can say "X (noun) なら Y (predicate)" when you think that the predicate Y applies only to X and is not more generally valid. The main ideas of a なら sentence, in other words, are contrast (as in Situation 1) and limitation (as in Situation 2).

> [!info] Usage
> Situation 1
> A. ブラジルに行ったことがありますか。
> Have you ever been to Brazil?
>
> B. チリなら行ったことがありますが、ブラジルは行ったことがありません。
> I've been to Chile, but never to Brazil. (If the question were about Chile, yes, but Brazil, no)
>
> Situation 2
> A. 日本語が読めますか。
> Can you read Japanese?
>
> B. ひらがななら読めます。
> If it is (written) hiragana, yes.

You can optionally keep the particle に before なら in this example and say チリなら. Particles such as に, で, and から may, but do not have to, intervene between the noun and なら, while は, が, and を never go with なら.

> [!note]
> なら introduces a sentence that says something "positive" about the item that is contrasted. In the first situation above, なら puts Chile in a positive light, and in contrast with Brazil, which the question was originally about. In the second situation, a smaller part, namely hiragana, is brought up and contrasted with a larger area, namely, the language as a whole.

# 一週間に三回

You can describe the frequency of events over a period of time by using the following framework.

> [!info] Usage
> (period) に　(frequency) ---> (frerquency) per (period)

> [!example]
> 一週間に何回髪を洗いますか。 How many times a week do you shampoo?
> 私は一週間に三回髪を洗います。I shampoo three times a week.

# Expression Notes
