# ~てあげる/てくれる/てもらう

> [!summary]
> We use the te-form + あげる when we do something for the sake of others, or somebody does something for somebody else.

> [!info]
> あげる puts focus on the fact that the actions were perfomed "on demand" or "as a favor".

For あげる sentences, the noun refering to the beneficiaries are accompanied by whatever particle the main verb calls for.

When you want to add the idea of "doing somebod a favor" to a verb which does not have the place for the beneficiary, you can use **~のために**.

> [!summary]
> We use くれる when somebody does something for us.

The beneficiary is almost always understood to be the speaker in くれる sentences. Just like with あげる, if the main verb has the place for the person receiving the benefit, keep the particle that goes with it. It the main verb does not have the place for the person, use **~のために**.

> [!summary]
> We use the te-form + もらう to say that we get, persuade, or arrange for, somebody to do something for us.

The person performing the action for us is accompanied by the particle に.

> [!info]
> Sometimes, a もらう sentence simply acknowledges a person's goodwill in doing something for us.

# ~ていただけませんか

> [!summary]
> We use the te-form of a verb + いただけませんか to make a polite request. This is more appropiate than ください when you request a favor from a nonpeer such as your professor or your boss or from a stranger

The te-form + くれませんか is a request which is roughly equal in the degree of politenes to ください.
This is probably the most appropiate in the a host-family context.

The te-form + くれない, or the te-form by itself, to ask for a favor in a very casual way. Good for speaking with members of your peer group.

# ~といい

You use the present tense short form + といいですね  
 (polite) or といいね (casual) to say that you hope something nice happens.

> [!info]
> You use these when you are wishing for the good luck of somebody other than yourself.

To say that you hope for your own good, you can use といいんですが (polite) or といいんだけど (casual).

> [!note]
> This shows that the speaker's attitude is more tentative and make the sentence sound more modest.

> [!info] Usage
> (short, present) と ---> いいですね I hope... (for you/them)
> ---> いいんですが/いいんだけど I hope... (for myself)

Note tha all these といい sentences are hoping for something nice to happen. These patterns cannot be used in cases where you hope to do something nice, which **is under your control**.

If I hope that you do something for me, that is, if I want to make an indirect request, we use てくれる before といいんですが.

# ~時

> [!info] Usage
> sentence A 時、sentences B。---> When A, B.

## The present tense in A.

If, at the time the main event B takes place, A is current or is still "in the future" use the present tense in A.

> [!example]
> チベットに行く時、ビザを取ります。
> When I go to Tibet \[=A\], I will get a visa \[=B\].

Note that as long as the event A occurs after the event B, the clause A gets the present tense,
irrespective of the tense in clause B.

> [!example]
> チベットに行く時、ビザを取りました。
> When I go to Tibet \[=A\], I will get a visa \[=B\].

In the previous example, the whole sequence of events has been shifted to the past; the temporal order between the two events is exactly the same as in the first example. Note especially that we use the present tense in A, even if the two events took place in the past.

> [!note]
> Clause A also gets the present tense when the state of A holds true when the event of B takes place.

Note that な-adjectives take な, and nouns take の before 時.

## The past tense in A

If, at the time of main event B, A is already "in the past" use the past tense in A. Note that we use the past tense even when the two events are yet to take place; it is the order of the two that matters.

> [!note]
> If A is a verbal idea (action) and describes an ongoing event during which B takes or took place, the verb in A is in the ている form. In the example below, the phone call event (=B) occurs in the middle of TV viewing (=A).
>
> テレビを見ている時、友だちから電話がありました。A phone call came when I was watching TV.

Note in this connection that it is wrong to use the following sentence pattern, because 行っている does not describe an ongoing event but is a description of the result of "going", that is, being in a faraway place after going.

# ~てすみませんでした

You use the te-form + すみませんでした, to describe the things you have done that you want to apologize for.

> [!usage]
> ~て+
> ---> すみませんでした (polite)
> ---> ごめん (casual)

When you want to apologize for something you have failed to do, you use ~なくて, the short, negative te-form of a verb.

> [!info]
> (To derive the form, first turn the verb into the short, negative ~ない, and then replace the last い with くて.

# Expression Notes

- このぐらいの大きさです ---> You can turn an い-adjective into a noun by replacing the last い with さ. Ex: 大きさ、優しさ、寂しさ. Some な-adjectives can likewise be turned into nouns by replacing な with さ, as in 便利さ.
- おごる ---> Is mainly used among friends. ごちそうする is a polite alternative for おごる. Use ごちそうする instead when the person who will treat, or treated, you to a meal is a superior, such as a teacher or a business associate. ごちそうする refers to "invite for a meal" as well as "pay for a meal
