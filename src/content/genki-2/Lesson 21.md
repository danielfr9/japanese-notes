# Passive Sentences

When you are inconvenienced by something somebody else has done, you can express your dissatisfaction using a passive sentence.

> [!info] Usage
> 私は　友だちに　車を使われました。
> (victim)は　(villain)に　(evil act)
>
> - The victim is affected by an event. Marked with the particle は or が.
> - The villain performs an action which causes the suffering. Marked with に.
> - The evil act is described with the passive form of a verb.

Passive form:

- **いる and える verbs**: Drop the final -ru and add -rareru
- **う-verbs**: Drop the final -u and add -areru
  - For う ending verbs, drop -u and add -wareru
- **irregular verbs**:
  - くる -> こられる
  - する -> される

Passive forms of verbs themselves conjugate as regular ru-verbs.

Conjugation of passive form:

| \_\_\_   | Affirmative | Negative       |
| -------- | ----------- | -------------- |
| Present: | 読まれる    | 読まれない     |
| Past:    | 詠まれた    | 読まれなかった |
| Te-form: | 読まれて    |

In most passive sentences, the "victim" has been unfavorably affected by the "villain's" act. They may be unfavorably affected in various ways, such as being angry, embarrassed, sad, or hurt.

> [!warning]
> Since the passive only applies to a verb, you cannot express your suffering from an adjectival situation. You cannot express your suffering from somebody failing to do something either.

Finally, we note that some passive sentences are not perceptibly unfavorable. When someone says these, they probably do not mean that they were inconvenienced by how things have turned out. There are relatively few verbs that come out neutral in their meaning when they are turned into the passive form.

There is another type of passive sentence, with non-human subjects, which naturally lacks the implication that the inanimate, nonsentient subjects are inconvenienced; commonly found in written language. The human agent of the actions in such sentences is followed by によって instead of に.

> [!note] Examples
> ここに公園が作られます。A park will be built here.
> この絵はピカソによって描かれました。The picture was drawn by Picasso.

# ~てある

You can use the te-form of a verb + the helping verb ある to characterize a situation that has been brought about on purpose by somebody who remains unnamed in the sentence.

> [!info] Usage
> ~が verb + てある ---> ... has been done on purpose

You can say ~てあります if somebody, possibly yourself, performed an action on purpose earlier, which can be described in terms of ~ておきました and if the result of that action can still be observed at this moment.

As you can see from the above examples, てある normally assigns the particle が (or は) to the noun, which is usually marked with を. てある almost exclusively goes with a transitive verb.

Compare also てある sentences with ている sentences that describe current states. ている goes with intransitive verbs, in contrast with てある.

# ~間に

Use "A 間に B" when a certain event B takes place in the middel of another event.

**_A_** goes with ている for actions in progess. **_A_** is in the present tense, even whe it describes a situation in the past. **_A_** can be a noun as well.

Event B must be of short duration and begin and end within the bounds of activity A. If B extends throughout the time when A occurs, we use 間 instead of 間に.

# Adjective + する

Adjective + する refers "to make".

- For い-adjectives, drop -い add くする
- For な-adjectives, drop -な add にする

Note also the following idiomatic use of this pattern:

- 静かにする make it quiet ---> keep quiet

# ~てほしい

To say you want somebody to do something. The person the wish is directed to is marked with the particle に.

> [!info] Usage
> (私は) person に verb te-form ほしい --> I want (person) to do...

When you want to say you don't want them to do something, you can negate ほしい and say ~てほしくないです or negate the verb and say ~ないでほしいです.

Summary for "want":
|
--- | ---
verb stem + たい | I want to do...
noun が ほしい | I want something
verb te-form + ほしい | I want somebody to do...

These are all private predicates, and used only for the speaker's wishes. When you want to describe the emotions of people other than the speaker, the predicate needs to be changed to a quote (と言っています) or an observation (ほしがっています).

# Expression Notes

- 何時ごろ帰ってきたか -> 帰ってくる is just like 帰る, except it implies in addition that you are speak from the point of view of a person who is at the destination of the return trip.
- バイトでためたお金もないです -> ないです is the alternative negative form of the verb ある. The standard negative form of ある is ありません, while the sub- standard alternative form is built up of the short form negative ない plus the politeness marker です.
