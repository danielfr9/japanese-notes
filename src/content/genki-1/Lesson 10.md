# Comparison between Two Items

> [!summary]
> In Japanese, adjectives do not change form in comparative sentences; there is no alteration as in "great/greater:' You can express the idea of comparison by framing a sentence with のほうが and/or より

> [!info] Usage
> A のほうが B より (property)。 ---> A is more (property) than B.

> [!warning] Grammar Notice
> In real life, the phrases A のほうが and B より often appear in the reverse order, making it very easy to be misled into believing the opposite of what is actually said. Don't rely on the word order, therefore, to decide which item is claimed to be superior. Listen carefully for the words のほうが and より.

If you want to ask a question comparing two items, you can say:

> [!info] Usage
> A と B と + どちらのほう/どっちのほう + が(property)。

> [!info]
> In place of どちらのほう and どっちのほう, you can also use どちら and どっち. Any one of these can be used in question sentences seeking comparisons between two items. どっち and どっちのほう are slightly more colloquial than どちら and どちらのほう.

# Comparison among Three or More Items

In comparison among three or more items, the degree qualifier いちばん is used.

> [!info] Usage
> { A と B と C } の中で A がいちばん(property)。

> [!warning] Grammar Notice
> Note that the words のほう and どっち are not used in statements of comparison among three or more items. Normal question words like だれ, どれ, 何, いつ, and どこ are used instead.

> [!tip]
> The tendency is to use だれ when a list of items is presented, and to use 何 when a group is referred to collectively.

# Adjective/Noun + の

> [!summary]
> When a noun follows an adjective, and when it is clear what you are referring to, you can replace the noun with the indefinite noun の, "one" to avoid repetition. の mostly stands for things, not people.

You can also use の in the sense of "mine" "yours", and so forth, referring to things owned by a person, or characterized by a place name.

# ~つもりだ

> [!summary]
> つもり follows verbs in the present tense short forms to describe what a person is planning to do in the future. You can also use a verb in the negative plus つもり to describe what you are planning not to do, or what you do not intend to do.

> [!info] Grammar Usage
> verb (short, present) + つもりだ --> (I) intend to do ...

> [!info]
> You can also use the past tense to talk about your original intention, which did not materialize.

# Adjective + なる

The verb なる means "to become" indicating a change. なる follows nouns and both types of adjectives.

> [!info] Usage
> い-adjectives: い --> ~くなる
> な-adjectives: Drop な --> ~になる
> nouns: noun + ~になる

> [!info]
> When you use an adjective with なる, you may be describing an absolute change (e.g., "it has become warm, hence it is not cold any longer") or a relative change (e.g., "it has become warmer, but it is still cold"). If you want to make clear that you are talking in relative terms, you can use the pattern for comparison together with なる.

# どこかに/どこにも

| word         | kanji    | word       | kanji      | word         | kanji      |
| ------------ | -------- | ---------- | ---------- | ------------ | ---------- |
| something    | 何か\_\_ | someone    | だれか\_\_ | somewhere    | どこか\_\_ |
| not anything | 何\_\_も | not anyone | だれ\_\_も | not anywhere | どこ\_\_も |

You do not need the particles は, が, or を with these words. You do need other particles, such as に, へ, and で. These particles appear in the places shown with underlines above.

# で

You can use the particle で with nouns that describe the means of transportation and the instruments you use.

# Expression Notes

- **買ってきます** --> You can use a verb te-form (買って in this example) + する to describe an action performed somewhere else, followed by a movement to your current location.

- **バスツアーがありますが** --> We sometimes use が and けど (but) at the end of a sentence when we want our partners to treat what we have just said as a given, common ground to build upon. These words often indicate the speaker's intention to give the partner a chance to react and speak up. By relegating the right to speak to one's partner, they also contribute to the politeness of one's utterance.
