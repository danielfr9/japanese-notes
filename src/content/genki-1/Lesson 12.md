Casual forms:

# ~でしょうか

> [!summary]
> To ask a question with a note of tentativeness and politeness (The person doesn't feel force to answer correctly)

でしょう means probably. By asking a でしょうか question, you are implying that you think the listener probably has a better-informed opinion, which you would appreciate.

> [!info] Usage
> でしょうか follow a short form predicate.

> [!warning]
> When it follows a noun or a な-adjective in a present tense affirmative sentence, it directly follows them, without だ in between.

> [!tip]
> You can use the non-interrogative でしょう to make a guess. You can add たぶん earlier in the sentence to signal that it is a guess.

In casual exchanges you can use でしょう (with the question intonation and most often pronounced as somewhat shorter でしょ) when you want to check if your partner agrees that you have the correct understanding about what you have just said.
