# ~たい

> [!summary]
> You can use ~たい(です) to describe your hope or aspiration.
>
> たい conjugates as an い-adjective

> [!info] Usage
> ==verb stem== + たいです ---> _I want to do..._

> [!tip]
> A verb that usually takes the particle を can have either the particle を or が when it is followed by たい. Particles other than を remain the same, as in the second example, which has に.

> [!warning] Grammar Notice
> You usually do not use たいです to describe wishes held by others. Somebody else's wishes are usually reported in Japanese either as quotations, observations, or guesses. So if you want to say that somebody other than you wants to do something, you can use と言っていました with たい.

To describe your observation to the effect that somebody wants to do something, you must use a special verb たがっている instead of たい. If a verb takes the particle を, the derived verb たがっている will retain を, unlike たい, with which we had a choice between the particles が and を.

# ~たり ~たりする

> [!summary]
> If you want to mention activities or events just as examples, and in no set order, as oppose to what te-form predicates tend to suggest, you can use a special predicate form ~たる~たりする.

> [!info] Usage
> ==verb (short,past)== + り, ==verb (short,past)== + りする ---> _do such things as this and that_

> [!tip]
> The helping verb する at the end of the sentence indicates the tense of the sentence.

You can change ~たり~たりする sentence into the past tense, or incorporate it in a bigger sentence, by working on the helping verb part.

# ~ことがある

> [!summary]
> The past tense short form of a verb + ことがある describes that you did something, or something happened, in earlier times.

> [!info] Usage
> ==verb (short,past,affirmative)== + ことがある ---> have the experience of ...

> [!warning] Grammar Notice
> If somebody asks you a question using ことがある, you can just say あります / ありません or repeat the whole verbal complex (行ったことがあります/行ったことがありません) but not ことがあります without a verb.

We learned in Lesson 9 another way to describe past experiences or lack thereof: もう~ました and まだ~ていません. Use まだ~ていません when you have not done something but expect to do it someday. In contrast, when you say ~ たことがありません, you do not think that you will eventually do it.

On the affirmative side, もう食べました means that the result of the eating that took place is still felt now, probably that is why you are not hungry right now. 食べたことがあります means that you have had that experience, and the eating event may have taken place years ago.

# Noun A や Noun B

> [!summary]
> や connects two nouns, as does と. や suggests that the things referred to are proposed as examples, and that you are not citing an exhaustive list in much the same way that たり suggests that the two verbs are used as examples.

# Expression Notes

- **は in negative sentences** ---> In negative sentences, you often find the particle は where you expect が or を.

  - を and が, respectively, would not be ungrammatical in the above examples. Many Japanese speakers, however, find the は versions more natural.

    The rule of thumb is that negative Japanese sentences tend to contain at least one は phrase. If you add 私は to the sentences above, therefore, the need for は is already fulfilled, and Japanese speakers feel much less compelled to use は after テレビ and コーヒー.

    は may also follow particles like で and に.

- **だけ** ---> You can add だけ to numbers to talk about having just that many items. だけ implies that you have something up to the amount needed, but not more than that.

  - だけ suggests that you can live with that few, though the number admittedly could have been higher.  There is also しか, which means "only" in the sense that you do not have enough of.

- **に** ---> You can use the particle に to indicate the occasion on which you do something.

  - に can also indicate the role you want something to play.

- **ドライブ** ---> Is used when you go somewhere by car for pleasure. To say "to have a drive" or "to go for a drive," use ドライブに行く or ドライブする.

  - When you simply want to say "to drive a car" (not necessarily for pleasure), use 運転する instead.

- **夢** ---> It, Like the English word "dream," has two meanings. One is the dream you have while sleeping; the others the dream that you wish would come true. To say "I have a dream" in Japanese, you use the verb 見る for sleeping dreams, and 持っている or ある for your visons.

- **には** ---> The particle は often follows the particle に in sentences describing a place in terms of the things that are found there.

  - (1) 東京にはデパートがたくさんあります。
  - (2) 東京にデパートがたくさんあります。
    There are many department stores in Tokyo.

    The first sentence is about the places: they answer questions (either explicitly asked, or implicitly) like "What is Tokyo like?" The second sentence, on the other hand, is an answer to a question like "Where do you find many department stores?"
